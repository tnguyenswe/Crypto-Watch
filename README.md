You can view the project at https://tnguyenswe.github.io/Crypto-Watch/

Crypto Watch is a web application built using Javascript, HTML, Node.JS, Express, and CSS.

I also used the Cryptonator API for real-time Cryptocurrency prices & used the Twilio API along with Node.JS to setup SMS notifications.

The API's can be found here:

This web application allows you to check real time Cryptocurrency prices as well as setup SMS notifications when a certain price change of your choosing is detected. Here are some demo photos:
